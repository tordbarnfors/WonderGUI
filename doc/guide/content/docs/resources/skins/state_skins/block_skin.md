# BlockSkin

A BlockSkin uses blocks of bitmap graphics in a Surface to represent the different states. One block of graphics (from the same surface) is used for each state specified in the Blueprint. All the blocks have the same size.

The location and size of the first block is specified by the *firstBlock* property in the Blueprint. The rest of the blocks are lined up either vertically or horizontally as specified by *axis* with optionally some spacing specified by the *spacing* property.

## Properties

| Property       | Set in state    | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| axis           | no             | Axis along which blocks in surface are line up.              |
| blendMode      | no             | BlendMode to use for all blocks.                             |
| blockless | only | Set in state if state has no block defined. |
| color          | yes   | Tint color for the block.                                    |
| firstBlock     | no             | Rectangle for first block of line of blocks to use. Mandatory. |
| frame          | no             | Border around nine patch center.                             |
| gradient       | no             | Tint gradient for all blocks.                                |
| rigidPartX     | no             | Specifies an optional vertical column that doesn't stretch along X-axis. |
| rigidPartY     | no             | Specifies an optional horizontal row that doesn't stretch along Y-axis. |
| spacing        | no             | Spacing between blocks in the surface.                       |
| surface        | no             | Surface containing the blocks.                               |

*RigidPartX* & *rigidPartY* are structs with properties:

| Property | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| begin    | offset along the axis in points for start of rigid section.  |
| length   | length in points of rigid section.                           |
| sections | What sections of nine patch that should be rigid. For rigidPartX the alternatives are: Top, Center, Bottom or All. For rigidPartY the alternatives are Left, Center, Right and All. |



## NinePatches

The blocks in a BlockSkin are so called "NinePatches" or "9-patches" (commonly used in Android UI interfaces among other places), consisting of 9 sections which allows us to resize them without stretching the corners and only stretching the sides in one dimension. 

When stretching a NinePatch image, the corners are just moved without any stretching. The sides are just stretched in one dimension to connect the corners and the center does the rest of the stretching.

This makes nine-patches very suitable for resizing rectangular shapes with a single-colored center since there will be none or minor artifacts from stretching.

In WonderGUI we simply define the size of the nine sections with a Border called *frame* in the Blueprint:

<img src="/docs/manual/9-patch.svg" alt="NinePatch image" width="40%"/>

From the four edges of the border we get nine sections. The arrows shows how each section will stretch when stretching the ninepatch.


## Reusing blocks between states

Sometimes you want use the same block in two or more states, but still needs to specify state-specific data. This can be done by setting the property *blockless* to true. The specified state will the not be counted when configuring the blocks.

As an example, imagine that we have an image with only two blocks: one for Default and one for Pressed. We want to use the Default block for states Hovered and Disabled but with some color tinting for effect. The relevant part of the blueprint could look something like this: 

```c++
.states = { State::Default, 
          { State::Hovered, { .blockless = true, .color = Color::Yellow }},
          { State::Pressed, 
          { State::Disabled, { .blockless = true, .color = Color::DarkGrey }}}
```



## Rigid parts

Sometimes you have a part of the NinePatch besides the corners that you don't want to stretch. For this we can define a rigid part along the X- and/or Y-axis.

Consider the following block and imagine that you don't want the angle brackets or the cross to stretch, just the empty areas between. The angle brackets can easily be solved by setting the frame, but the cross is in the center section and therefore will be stretch in both directions:

<img src="/docs/manual/9-patch-crosshair.svg" alt="NinePatch with crosshair image" width="40%"/>

To solve this we can define one "rigid part" along each axis that doesn't stretch, called *rigidPartX* and *rigidPartY*. Anything within rigidPartX won't stretch horizontally and anything within rigidPartY won't stretch vertically. We can also specify which sections the rigid part affects and in this case we specify center:

<img src="/docs/manual/9-patch-crosshair-rigid-parts.svg" alt="NinePatch with rigid parts" width="40%"/>

The section specified may only cover the parts normally stretching along that axis, which means Top, Center and Bottom for the X-axis and Left, Center and Right for the Y-axis.


In this case the sections both starts 15 points along their axis and have a length of 12 points, so the relevant code in the blueprint could look something like this:

```c++
.rigidPartX = { .begin = 15, .length = 12, .sections = YSections::Center }
.rigidPartY = { .begin = 15, .length = 12, .sections = XSections::Center }
```

Now the cross won't stretch, but the area around will. Technically the block will now not only be split into the 9 sections defined by the frame, but 17 sections:

<img src="/docs/manual/17-patch.svg" alt="NinePatch with 17 sections" width="40%"/>


We could set sections to All instead of Center and it would look the same but result in 8 more sections since each border would be split into three, which negatively affects rendering speed.

A more typical use case for rigid parts might be a tooltip in the shape of a speech bubble:

<img src="/docs/manual/9-patch-speech-bubble.svg" alt="NinePatch speech bubble" width="40%"/>

In this case we only need to define a rigid section along the X-axis and set sections to Bottom:

```c++
.rigidPartX = { .begin = 15, .length = 7, .sections = YSections::Bottom }
```

This only results in the lower border section being split up into three sections for a total of 11 sections.

## Examples

In this example we have four blocks representing the states Default, Hovered, Pressed and Disabled of a simple button. Each block is 10x10 pixels, they are arranged horizontally and there is no spacing between them. The border around the center piece of the NinePatch is 4 pixels all around.

![skin-borders](/docs/manual/9-patch-button.png)


In the code we define the block as follows:

```c++

auto pButtonSkin = BlockSkin::create( { 
    .axis = Axis::X,
    .firstBlock = {0,0,10,10},
    .frame = 4,
    .states ={ State::Default, State::Hovered, 
               State::Pressed, State::Disabled }
    .surface = pSurf,

});
```

As you can see we can just specify the states without any curly brackets or data when there is no state-specific data. We need to specify the same amount of states as we have blocks and in the right order.

When stretching this graphics and changing states we now get the desired result:

However, there is one more thing we want to do before we are done. If we add some text to the button we get the following effect:

As you can see, the skin has a nice 3D-effect when pressed, but the text remains static, which looks weird. We solve this by adding some contentShifting to the pressed state:

```c++
auto pButtonSkin = BlockSkin::create( { 
    .axis = Axis::X,
    .firstBlock = {0,0,10,10},
    .frame = 4,
    .states ={ State::Default, State::Hovered, 
              { State::Pressed, { .contentShift = {2,2} }, State::Disabled }
    .surface = pSurf,
});
```

And finally we have a good looking button:
