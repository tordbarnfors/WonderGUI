# Graphics Streaming

WonderGfx has an extension for graphics streaming, in which the render primitives can be packed into a binary stream.

The stream can then be stored or transported to another device for playback. It can also be dumped to a human-readable log for debugging and performance tuning.
This section deals with the ins and outs of the streaming extension.
